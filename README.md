# Aureola

A collection of conky's I like.

These conky's configuration files follow the LUA syntax as mentioned on the website for version 1.10 and later versions.
They will be first tested and made on Linux Mint and then tested on other Os's.

A little script is present to copy the config file to the right location and copy the autostart for conky.
