# Aureola

A collection of conky's I made myself and conky's I like that were shared with the community.

These conky's configuration files follow the LUA syntax as mentioned on the conky website for version 1.10 and later versions.

Conky's are will be first tested and made on Linux Mint and then tested on other Os's.


# Installation of conky

To be added at a later date.



# Installation of Aureola conky collection

A little script is present to copy the config file to the right location and copy the autostart for conky.

At the moment of creating this collection I found out that conky had decided to follow the LUA syntax for their configuration files.

Adapted this conky so it is now compliant to the lua syntax. This has a LUA script that draws the rings etc.
